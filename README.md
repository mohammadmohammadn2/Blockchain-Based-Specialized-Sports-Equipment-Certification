# Blockchain-Based Specialized Sports Equipment Certification

A decentralized solution for verifying, authenticating, and managing specialized sports equipment throughout its lifecycle.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, immutable record of sports equipment certification. The platform connects manufacturers, testing authorities, retailers, and end users in a trustless ecosystem that ensures equipment authenticity, safety compliance, and efficient recall management.

## Core Components

### Manufacturer Verification Contract

The manufacturer verification contract establishes a registry of legitimate equipment producers, ensuring only authorized entities can register products.

- **Manufacturer Registration**: Onboarding process with KYC verification
- **Digital Signatures**: Equipment tagged with manufacturer's cryptographic signature
- **Reputation System**: Tracks manufacturer history and compliance record
- **Authority Management**: Defines who can add or revoke manufacturer status

### Testing Certification Contract

This contract manages the certification process, recording compliance with relevant safety and performance standards.

- **Standard Registration**: Repository of applicable standards for each equipment type
- **Test Results Storage**: Immutable record of all testing outcomes
- **Certification Issuance**: Creation of digital certificates for compliant equipment
- **Auditing Capabilities**: Verification of testing processes and results

### Authentication Contract

Enables verification of equipment authenticity throughout the supply chain and by end users.

- **Unique Identifiers**: Each piece of equipment receives a non-fungible token (NFT)
- **Ownership Tracking**: Records chain of custody from manufacturer to end user
- **Verification Interface**: Simple methods for confirming authenticity
- **Anti-Counterfeiting Measures**: Cryptographic proof of genuine products

### Recall Management Contract

Facilitates the identification and notification of safety issues across the equipment lifecycle.

- **Recall Initiation**: Authorized entities can trigger equipment recalls
- **Notification System**: Alerts sent to all registered owners of affected equipment
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitors recall response rates
- **Resolution Documentation**: Records remediation actions taken

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible chain (mainnet, sidechains, or L2 solutions)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts with robust security measures
- **Storage**: IPFS for test reports and detailed documentation
- **Oracles**: Integration with physical verification systems (QR, NFC, RFID)
- **Frontend**: Web and mobile interfaces for different user types

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to blockchain testnet (Sepolia, Mumbai, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/sports-equipment-certification.git
   cd sports-equipment-certification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Compile contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy to testnet:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

## Usage Examples

### For Manufacturers

```javascript
// Register as a manufacturer
await manufacturerContract.register(
  companyName,
  registrationDocumentCID,
  manufacturerWallet
);

// Register new equipment
await authenticationContract.registerEquipment(
  equipmentType,
  modelNumber,
  batchNumber,
  technicalSpecsCID
);
```

### For Testing Authorities

```javascript
// Record test results
await testingContract.certifyEquipment(
  equipmentId,
  standardsVersion,
  testResultsCID,
  passStatus
);
```

### For Retailers and End Users

```javascript
// Verify equipment authenticity
const isAuthentic = await authenticationContract.verifyEquipment(equipmentId);

// Check recall status
const recallInfo = await recallContract.checkRecallStatus(equipmentId);
```

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety**: Immediate verification of equipment compliance with safety standards
- **Fraud Prevention**: Reduction in counterfeit equipment circulation
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined certification and recall processes
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into equipment history and certification status
- **Consumer Confidence**: Reliable authentication of equipment authenticity

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Integration with physical IoT sensors for real-time equipment condition monitoring
- **Q3 2025**: Implementation of governance mechanisms for standards updates
- **Q4 2025**: Cross-chain compatibility for wider ecosystem integration
- **Q1 2026**: Mobile app with AR verification capabilities
